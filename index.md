## PCA-LSTM for Stock Prediction

The prediction of stock market fluctuations has long been a crucial area of research in the financial field. Traditional analysis methods often struggle to reveal the hidden information behind these fluctuations, leading to a reduction in prediction accuracy. In this project, I implemented the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method to reduce the dimensionality of the data, and combined it with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict stock prices. The results showed that using PCA-LSTM yielded higher prediction accuracy than using LSTM alone.

## Cost & Delivery Time Prediction

Managing a high-performance supply chain requires a precise understanding of the time and cost required for product delivery. Accurately predicting delivery time and cost by analyzing historical data (time series) is crucial. In this project, I developed delivery time prediction using various machine learning models and selected the best model for prediction. Additionally, I developed cost of delivery prediction using LightGBM models, which yielded the best results for cost prediction.
